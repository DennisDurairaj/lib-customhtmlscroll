CustomHTMLScroll v1.0.0 provides support for custom scrollbars in 
webpages. There are a few ideas behind this project that should 
be retained: 

The library must be easy to implement. That means, drop the 
javascript in your page, call a single function to initiate the 
scrollbar, and style the scrollbar to your wishes. This also 
means that the HTML shouldn't need to be structured in a certain 
way for the library to work. 

The library shouldn't depend on other libraries, as they may 
change. We don't want to create unneeded dependencies. These are 
risks that may break projects, or keep developers from updating 
the frameworks that they do use.
